Finally I have spent the time to buy a domain and put together a (work in progress) blog. What finally pushed me to do it? I recently attended An [Event Apart in San Francisco][aea-sf] and within the first hour of the conference, [Mr. Zeldman][zeldman-twitter] suggested that everybody in the room should "blog like nobody is reading it, because nobody is." He said that writing makes you think differently, as well as making you more articulate. This isn't new stuff, but it resonated with me... so here I am... blogging... after all these years.

Next up: My summary of day one of An Event Apart and customizing my blog from the Jekyll defaults.
